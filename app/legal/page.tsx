      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">{"Terms & Conditions"}</h1>

      <p className="mb-2 text-sm text-gray-500">Effective Date: June 23, 2025</p>
      <p className="mb-6">Operated by: 3WB Labs Inc. (Delaware Corporation)</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">By accessing or using the 3WB Fleet Financing Platform ("Platform"), you agree to be legally bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Eligibility</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Be at least 18 years old</li>
        <li>Be legally permitted to participate in investment opportunities under your local laws</li>
        <li>Provide accurate KYC information (email, ID, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">We reserve the right to refuse access to anyone for any reason.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. Nature of the Platform</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">The Platform enables you to fund three-wheeler vehicles through fractional or full contributions. Your funds are pooled to finance vehicles leased to vetted drivers in our operating markets. This is not a lending or deposit-taking platform. Your participation is at your own risk.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Returns & Payouts</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Returns are generated from weekly payments made by drivers under hire-purchase agreements. You may receive weekly payouts proportionate to your funded amount over the lease term (typically ~60 weeks). Return estimates (e.g. 75% ROI) are not guaranteed and are subject to driver performance and platform risk.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">5. Ownership and Asset Structure</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">All vehicles remain the property of 3WB Labs Inc. or its designated fleet partners until fully paid off. Investors do not take legal title to the vehicles but have a contractual right to income from assigned assets. Vehicles may be reassigned if a driver defaults or exits early.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">6. Risk Disclosure</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Your capital is at risk.</li>
        <li>Returns depend on real-world performance.</li>
        <li>While 3WB Labs Inc. uses vetting, pooling, and reserves to mitigate risk, losses are possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">7. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">We may modify these Terms at any time. Updates will be posted on the Platform. Continued use means acceptance of the changes.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">8. Termination</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Provide false information</li>
        <li>Attempt to misuse the platform</li>
        <li>Violate applicable laws or these Terms</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">9. Governing Law</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in Delaware courts.</p>
